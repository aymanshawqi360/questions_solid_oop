# OOP and SOLID Principles in Dart/Flutter - Week 1 Assessment

This repository contains my solutions to the Week 1 Multiple-Choice Assessment focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and SOLID principles applied in Dart/Flutter projects. The assessment covers identifying key design violations in various Dart code snippets and proposing appropriate fixes to improve code quality, maintainability, and extensibility.
## Key Highlights

- Applied **Encapsulation** by privatizing class fields and adding validated getters/setters.
- Respected **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** by separating concerns (e.g., separating persistence logic from the data model).
- Ensured **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)** by using polymorphism and inheritance to allow extensibility without modifying existing code.
- Reduced tight coupling using **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** by depending on abstractions instead of concrete implementations.
- Improved interface design by applying **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** to avoid bloated interfaces.
